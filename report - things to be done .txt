start with a specific move of musketeer
implement symmetry
background:
	idea of solving games
	value of solving (purpose)
	types of solving
	methods of solving(alpha-beta, min-max, depth-first, heuristics)
Our task:
	game chosen
	previous work on this game
	value of replicating the studies
Methods:
	first-version, difficulties(bugs)
	fixed version
	norvig's implementation
	run-time and memory limitation
	computing the first levels of the game tree by hand\
	and feeding it.
results:
	main result(musketeers always win)
	computation statistics
future work:
	implementation with the symmetry handling
	strong solving
	just two musketeers in the game
		(*)if we prove it, 
Conclusion:
	summarizing (what,why,how) we did it
	what it can do for game playing
		-strong solving: value of it
